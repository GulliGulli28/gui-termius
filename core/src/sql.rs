//! MySQL/PostgreSQL client — connects either directly to a database server
//! or tunnelled through an existing saved SSH host (see
//! [`crate::model::SqlConnection::tunnel_host_id`]), introspects the schema
//! (databases/schemas, tables, columns via `information_schema`), and runs
//! ad-hoc queries. Lives directly in `core/` rather than a separate sidecar
//! process/workspace (contrast RDP's `rdp-sidecar` — see CLAUDE.md's
//! "Pourquoi un processus RDP séparé"): `sqlx` was checked against this
//! workspace's existing dependency graph (`russh`/`kube`/`reqwest`/
//! `bollard`) before adding it and resolves cleanly, reusing the same
//! `ecdsa`/`rustls` versions already pulled in — no exact-pin conflict like
//! `ironrdp-connector`'s `picky` dependency had.
//!
//! **MySQL vs. PostgreSQL browsing shape.** A MySQL connection can list and
//! switch between every database on the server without reconnecting (each
//! query below just runs `information_schema` lookups scoped to whichever
//! database name is passed in). A PostgreSQL connection is permanently
//! scoped to the one database named at connect time — there is no
//! server-wide "list every database" step that would actually be
//! browsable, only *schemas* within that fixed database. [`list_schemas`]
//! reflects this honestly instead of faking a uniform "databases" list:
//! MySQL databases and PostgreSQL schemas are exposed through the same
//! function/tree level because they're the same *browsing granularity* for
//! each engine, not because they're the same concept.
//!
//! **[`SqlPool`], not `sqlx::Any` — verified against a real server, not just
//! reasoned about.** An earlier version of this module used `sqlx`'s
//! generic `Any` driver so [`list_schemas`]/[`list_tables`]/[`list_columns`]/
//! [`execute_query`] wouldn't need an engine-specific branch. That driver
//! only decodes a **closed 9-variant type set**
//! (`Null`/`Bool`/`SmallInt`/`Integer`/`BigInt`/`Real`/`Double`/`Text`/
//! `Blob` — verified in the vendored `sqlx-core-0.8.6/src/any/{type_info,
//! row,value}.rs`), and normalizes every backend's native types down to it.
//! Against a real PostgreSQL server this broke immediately: `schema_name`/
//! `table_name`/`column_name` are `sql_identifier` (a domain over the
//! internal `NAME` type, not `TEXT`), so introspection failed outright, and
//! `execute_query` hard-failed on *any* table with a `NUMERIC`/
//! `TIMESTAMP(TZ)`/`UUID`/`JSON(B)` column — i.e. most real tables — because
//! those types have no representation in the 9-variant set at all. This
//! isn't the "a decode that still fails falls back to JSON `null`" case the
//! previous version's decoder was built to tolerate: the row itself can't
//! be converted to `Any`'s row type in the first place, so the failure
//! surfaces before any per-cell decoding even runs, and takes out the whole
//! query. [`SqlPool`] instead wraps the real per-engine pool
//! (`sqlx::PgPool`/`sqlx::MySqlPool`), decoded by [`decode_pg_value`]/
//! [`decode_mysql_value`] against the actual type each backend reports.
//! Exercised end-to-end against a real PostgreSQL server (tunnelled through
//! a real SSH host, `core/examples/sql_wsl_smoke.rs`) — MySQL's decode path
//! mirrors the same verified-compatibility approach but has not had the
//! same live test yet.
//!
//! **SQLite is a third, structurally different engine.** MySQL/PostgreSQL
//! are servers this module dials over TCP (optionally through an SSH
//! tunnel); SQLite is an embedded single-file engine with no server or wire
//! protocol at all. A [`SqlConnection`] with `engine: Sqlite` uses `path`/
//! `sqlite_host_id` instead of `address`/`port`/`username`/`database` (see
//! those fields' doc comments): a local file is opened directly, a file on a
//! saved host's filesystem is fetched whole over SFTP into a local temp copy
//! at [`connect`] time and — since there's no way to run SQL against it
//! remotely — queried entirely against that copy, written back to the
//! original path only on a clean [`SqlSession::close`] (see [`connect_sqlite`]).
//! [`list_schemas`] reflects SQLite's single implicit schema as one `"main"`
//! entry, so the same tree UI that browses MySQL databases/PostgreSQL
//! schemas works unmodified.
//!
//! **Other known limitations, accepted for a first version:**
//! - No primary-key/index information in [`list_columns`] — name/type/
//!   nullability only, to keep the introspection query itself simple and
//!   fully portable (the `information_schema.columns` shape used here is
//!   identical for both engines).
//! - [`execute_query`] can't report a precise "N rows affected" for an
//!   INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DDL statement — see its doc comment.
//! - No streaming `Channel` for query results (see [`QueryResult`]'s doc
//!   comment) — a hard row cap instead, consistent with how this app
//!   already treats "small/bounded" vs. "hot path" data going to the
//!   frontend (`docs/dev-history.md`'s RDP-frames section spells out that
//!   threshold).
//! - A remote-hosted SQLite file's changes only reach the origin host if the
//!   session is closed cleanly — an app crash/kill between `connect` and
//!   `close` loses them (same accepted tradeoff `SqlSession`'s doc comment
//!   already states for the MySQL/PostgreSQL tunnel case).

///   anything `String`/`Vec<u8>`-compatible. Tried after `String`, so it
///   only ever actually reaches real `JSON` columns in practice.
/// - `bool`'s check accepts *any* integer-family column (MySQL has no
///   native boolean — `BOOLEAN` is an alias for `TINYINT(1)`, and the
///   `compatible()` check doesn't verify the `(1)` width), so a genuine
///   `INT`/`BIGINT` column would just as happily "decode" as a `bool`.
